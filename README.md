# After-Hours
After-Hours is a game project currently in early BETA development. Focusing on horror, collaboration, AI pathing, and utilizing lobby systems to make the user experience seamless.

# Overview
- the goal of this game is to have a time limit (10 minutes) and for the playerrs to complete their shift
- the CEO (Main enemy AI system) will survey the perimeter and attack any employed that are slacking
- (we could go with choosing maybe a direct pathing for the AI or maybe just randomized pathing as long as the AI can detect walls and not get stuck)
- This repository is being initialized to support collaborative development. Core systems, including a lobby system, will be added in future commits.

# Core Gameplay
- Box sorting animations will play when the player Presses 'E' on a certain platform next to a conveyor belt and will provide the player with a box to go into the rest of the warehouse to place someones "amazon order"
- there will be a counter at the end of the game showing how many boxes each player has shipped
- Players will have a (bladder meter) which will decrease their health if full in order to create an incentive to leave your workspace into the rest of the warehouse
- players will be able to decrease their bladder meter down to zero by interacting with a bathroom toilet

# Status
Repository initialized
Core systems pending :D
