# After-Hours

After-Hours is a game project currently in development.

# Overview
- the goal of this game is to have a time limit (10 minutes) and for the playerrs to complete their shift
- the CEO (Main enemy AI system) will survey the perimeter and attack any employed that are slacking
- (we could gow with choosing maybe a direct pathing for the AI or maybe just randomized pathing as long as the AI can detect walls and not get stuck)
- Players will have a (bladder meter) which will decrease their health if full in order to create an incentive to leave your workspace into the rest of the warehouse
- players will be able to decrease their bladder meter down to zero by interacting with a bathroom toilet
- Box sorting animations will also play when the player Presses 'E' next to a conveyor belt 


This repository is being initialized to support collaborative development.
Core systems, including a lobby system, will be added in future commits.

## Status
- Repository initialized
- Core systems pending
